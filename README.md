Code of Conduct
Welcome to UD, the Biden School, Principle of Urban Science! Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class.
I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all of you, to assure we maintain and foster a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. No instances of harassment or attempts to marginalize students will be tolerated in my class. No instances of bullying, or cyber-bullying. If you have concerns, if you do not feel safe or are made to feel unwelcome, please come talk to me - keeping in mind that I am a mandatory TitleIX reporter. Read the full Code of Conduct here 
Course Description 
This course will teach you the basis of data driven research on urban environments. 
You will acquire basic computational skills, basic knowledge of statistical analysis including traditional methods and machine learning, error analysis, good practises for handling data and big-data, and communication and visualization skills. After this class you should be able to formulate a question relevant to Urban Science, findan appropriate data to answer the question, prepare and analyze the data, get an answer, to whichever confidence level, and communicate your answer, and your confidence level in the answer. 
This is an interdisciplinary class that combines technical and domain skills. Don't worry about how much you already know, especially do not compare it to what other students know: all skills and perspectives will come together to solve problems. 
The course will be organized in a modular fashion, with some guest lectures. 
	

Meeting pattern: T-Th 3:30-4:50PM online at 
The instructors is: Dr. Federica Bianco fbianco@udel.edu 
oﬃce hours: Tentatively: Tuesdays 1200-2PM (or by appointment).




Each week you will have two sessions, each a mix of  lecture and lab. Classes are synchronous and attendance in lecture and lab is mandatory. The material will be covered in the slides handed out every week and, but participating to the class and the discussions therein will be crucial for your development in the class.		

**Learning Outcomes**
By the end of this class you should be able to formulate an appropriate analysis plan for a research question, select, gather, and prepare data for analysis, and choose and apply machine learning methods to the data.				

### Books: 

Books are available online, for free - check the class wensite.

### Technology :

Google Collaboratory will be used for the class. Homework can be developed on any platform as long as the computational set up is consistent for the entire class: I need to be able to reproduce your work and obtain the same results on google collab. Modules and library used in your work need to be accessible to me, the graders, and your classmates.

The course will be organized in a modular fashion, with some guest lectures. Each statistical and machine learning method will be studied as it is applied to a physical problem, based on open data and literature examples.

### Homework : 

Homework will be exclusively received through github.

Homework projects must be turned in as iPython notebooks by checking them into your github account in the PUS2020_<fistinitialLastname>/HW<hwnumber>_<fistinitialLastname> repo (unless otherwise stated).			
Assessment 
Grades are based on 

-15%  pre-class questions
-15%  labs performance and participation 
-20% homework 
-20% midterm 
-30% ﬁnal 

Weekly assignments will be handed out at the end of the class, and will be due strictly before the first class of the following week on Monday 12:00PM Noon unless otherwise stated (no submissions at all can be accepted after that as the homework may be reviewed in class). 

Before each class there will be a set of questions to be answered about the material covered in previous lectures. This serves to assure you review the material as we go, and to assure that a topic was generally understood by the class before we move to the next one. In other words, this is more an assessment of how clear I was at teaching something than anything else. Nonetheless, to enforce a regular review of the material, the pre-class questions will be graded. Please come to class on time: at the beginning of each class you will be handed a sheet of “Pre-class Questions” to be answered before each lecture and lab. You will have up to 7 minutes after the official start time of the class to answer them.  The later you arrive at the class, the less time you will have to answer the questions. 

Late homework will not be accepted. A single 72-hour exception is allowed throughout the semester, explicitly declare that you are going to use it before the deadline, and do use it wisely. If you fail to turn in an assignment that will be a 0, and (likely) the lowest grade. However, the lowest grade in the first half of the course (before midterm), and the lowest grade in the second half will be disregarded in assigning you a final grade.

I encourage you to work in groups of up to 3 people, but as a collaborative project. Individual notebooks must be returned for each homework. Different group members should lead different aspects of the work.  A statement must be included in the README explaining each team member’s contribution (similar to an acknowledge of contribution you would find in a Nature letter see, for example these contributions). Midterm and Final will include aspects of the work developed in the homework sessions. 
For the Midterm and the Final you are responsible for material in the labs, the reading, and the homework. 
There will be opportunities for extra credit projects to improve your grade after the first half of the semester (grade counting toward participation).
